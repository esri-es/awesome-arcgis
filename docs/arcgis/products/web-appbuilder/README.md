## Introduction
Web AppBuilder has two versions:
* ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS hosted version (for non-developers): A WYSIWYG tool that allow them to build and export responsive web apps adding and configuring pre-defined widgets and themes.

* [Developer Edition](developer-edition/README.md) (for developers): It is a self-hosted version but also a framework that can be extended adding custom themes and widgets.

**In this page we will focus on the hosted version**.

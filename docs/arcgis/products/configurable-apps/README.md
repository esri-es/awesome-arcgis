## Introduction
So far Esri has released more than 40 [open source templates](#apps-developed-by-esri)
with different purposes: collect/edit data, compare maps/layers,
explore/summarize data, get directions, map social media, provide local
information, showcase 2D or 3D maps, etc.

The best thing is that **you as a developer can write your own templates** ([learn how](#training)).

Check the configurable apps Esri has been releasing during the last years:


[![Esri configurable apps evolution](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=1770&h=1318)](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=3539&h=2635)

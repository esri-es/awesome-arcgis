## Introduction
The [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/) is the technology you may want to use if you want to build you Android application in Java. If you are interested on building Android applications but not necessarily using this language you could also use:

* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](../dot-net/README.md), using C# with Xamarin you can build application which runs on Android, iOS and Windows Phones.
* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt](../qt/README.md): using C++ & QML you can also build application for Android and iOS.

As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of [our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123](../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders).

## Training
* [Documentation: Android Guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/latest/guide/welcome-to-the-help-for-arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-android.htm)

* ["Android + ArcGIS" at Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=android+arcgis)
* [Mobile map package](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/latest/guide/mobile-map-package.htm): is a file object (.mmpk) created in ArcGIS Pro. It is a transport mechanism for maps, their layers, data, networks, and locators. A mobile map package can be sideloaded onto a device by email, or by platform-specific transfer mechanism, or it can be downloaded from a portal to the device. It available for applications developed using ArcGIS Runtime SDK starting with version 100.0.

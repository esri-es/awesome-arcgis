# Virtual Reality Developers
Export 3D scenarios built using [City Engine](../arcgis/products/city-engine/README.md), export them to [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine) and build your application using any VR SDK to finish the application for your [VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) [headset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset).

## Introduction

This video can help you understand what can be done with ArcGIS and virtual.

To build you own applications using ArcGIS scenarios you first need to build the
scenario using [City Engine](../arcgis/products/city-engine/README.md) and then you will be able to export it and consume it using Unity.

## Training

To be able to build your own VR applications using ArcGIS scenarios you should learn about City Engine and Unity:

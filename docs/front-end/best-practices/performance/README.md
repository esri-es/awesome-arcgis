## Introduction
In addition to the [performance best practices on the ArcGIS Platform](../../../arcgis/best-practices/performance/README.md)
we want to show you two ways to improve your performance when talking about web
applications: [Load time](#load-time) or [Drawing features](drawing-features).

## Load time

You should know that there are a web application called "[Web Optimizer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jshelp/inside_web_optimizer.html)"
that generates custom builds of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. The advantage of
using a custom build is that your application downloads and parses only the
required JavaScript resources which will make your application load faster.

* [arcgis-js-api](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-js-api): Bower friendly, minified version of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

* [NPM and ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.3](https://geonet.esri.com/community/developers/web-developers/arcgis-api-for-javascript/blog/2017/04/13/npm-and-arcgis-api-for-javascript-43)

Grunt? Bower?

### Training
#### Videos / Technical talks

* [Using NPM with ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0MOsQ8rAjg)

* [Optimizing Your JavaScript App for Performance](http://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=5029&channelid=LegacyVideo&isLegacy=true&title=optimizing-your-javascript-app-for-performance)

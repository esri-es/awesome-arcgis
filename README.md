## Quick overview
No matter your background or your favourite technology, we have putted together many links to help you find tools, code samples, training, and help you get started with ArcGIS.

Start check the section that best matches with you:
* [Front-end developer](front-end/README.md)
* [Back-end developer](back-end/README.md)
* [Mobile developer](mobile/README.md)
* [Desktop developer](desktop/README.md)
* [DevOps](devops/README.md)
* [Virtual reality developers](vr/README.md)

In order help you better understand the technology we have also collected some links to introduce you to [the content](arcgis/content/README.md) you have available in the platform and [which are the benefits of developing using ArcGIS](arcgis/README.md).

This diagram displays an overview of the technologies available for ArcGIS developers:

## About ArcGIS
ArcGIS is a 360ยบ software platform built by Esri and it already have more than
[100 software tools](http://www.esri.com/products#alpha-list). Many of those tools are end-user software like desktop
applications or mobile Applications but there are also many tools for developers
and devops as you will see in this awesome list of resources.

**About Esri**

[Esri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri) (Environmental Systems Research Institute) was founded in 1969 by [Jack and Laura Dangermond](https://givingpledge.org/pdf/pledge-letters/Dangermond_Letter.pdf). Today it software ( [ArcGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS) ) is been used by a [40% of the global market](https://apb.directionsmag.com/entry/esri-has-40-of-gis-marketshare/215188). The company have more than [350000 customers worldwide, 8000 employees, 1600 partners](http://www.esri.com/about-esri#who-we-are), [90 offices](http://www.esri.com/about-esri/contact#outsideUS) and [$1.1B on revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri).

It [organize multiple events](http://www.esri.com/events) annually and the biggest one (the [User Conference](http://www.esri.com/events/user-conference) in San Diego) brings together more than 15000 users. There is also a developer focused event, the **Developer Summit**, it take place at [Palm Springs](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit) (USA) and [Berlin](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-europe) (EU) every year.
